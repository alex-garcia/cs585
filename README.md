I uploaded the whole project to git hub through the Android Studio so it looks like a lot of the files are redundant.
The main java files that I wrote are in cs585/app/src/main/java/com/example/cs585/cs585/.

Just run the program and click the objects to see the program account for when each button is pushed and in which sequence it is
pushed in.  THere is a 3 second gap between each sequence of button pressed before they are displayed to the user.
Press the exit app button to see how often each button was pressed.
